# About this project
This project aims to be an informative graphical tool for anyone trying to wrap their heads around a variety of pathfinding algorithms or who wishes to compare how two algorithms work given the same graph layout. Each algorithm is run on a 2d grid where obstacles can be placed and the positions of the start and end positions can be modified. Once started the algorithm will begin to search the grid for the goal node according to its own rules and methods which can be seen in real time. 

Please note that for the project I have set my own speed for how fast the nodes are searched, in reality each algorithm will find the goal in a few miliseconds or less but then that wouldn't be very fun to look at :)

The project was built using Javascript, React and styled using SASS.
